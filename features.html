    <h3 id="vigan">Vigan City</h3>
    <p align="justify">Located on the western coast of the large island of Luzon, facing the South China Sea, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it is one of the few Spanish colonial towns left in the Philippines whose old structures have mostly remained intact, and it is well known for its sett pavements and a unique architecture of the Spanish Philippines colonial era which fuses Native Philippine and Oriental building designs and construction, with colonial Spanish architecture that is still abundant in the area, mainly the Bahay na Bato houses and an Earthquake Baroque church. Former Philippine president Elpidio Quirino, the sixth President of the Philippines, was born in Vigan, at the former location of the Provincial Jail (his father was a warden); he resided in the Syquia Mansion. The entire city of Vigan was later inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage City after being declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is a member of the Organization of World Heritage Cities (OWHC).<br>

    In May 2015, Vigan City was officially recognized as one of the New7Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and La Paz. New 7 Wonders Foundation president and founding member Bernard Weber led a ceremony held at St. Paul Cathedral where he handed a bronze plaque to Vigan Mayor Eva Grace Singson-Medina, signifying the heritage city's election as one of the world's wonder cities.</p>

    <h2>Places you can visit</h2>
    <div><h3>Calle Crisologo</h3>
    <p>Calle Crisologo is Vigan's most populationar tourist attraction. The grounds and pavements of this preserved street are made of cobblestones, and both sides are lined with ancestral houses that are reminiscent of old Spanish towns.<br>

    During the daytime, the street is a busy commercial district, with most shops selling quality antiques, furniture, and jewelry pieces. <br>

    You can indulge yourself in souvenir shopping, including native food products and delicacies, or snag world-class hand-woven clothing, blankets, and other accessories at Rowilda's Weaving.<br>

    You can ride a kalesa (horse-drawn carriage), which is the only vehicle plying Calle Crisologo. <br>

    A kalesa ride is good for an hour and can take you around Calle Crisologo and the rest of the Vigan Heritage Village, including the Vigan Cathedral and Plaza Burgos.<br>

    It's a totally different scene at night, as Calle Crisologo transforms into a dining strip where loads of people eat alfresco and enjoy drinks to cap the night off.<br>
    <img src="img/calle.jpg" width="400" height="200"/>
    </p><br>

    <h3>Vigan Cathedral</h3>
    <p>​Also called the Saint Paul Metropolitan Cathedral, the Vigan Cathedral is another important landmark in Ilocos Sur's capital city. <br>

    It stands in a prominent spot just in front of Plaza Salcedo, which is why you might find many tourists having their pictures taken between these notable structures.<br>

    The cathedral pays homage to Baroque architecture as seen in the ornate details outside and inside the church, although the cathedral has had its share of renovations too to make it sturdier.<br>
    <img src="img/vigancathedral.jpg" width="400" height="200"/>
    </p>


    <h3>Bantay</h3>
    <p>Nothing else can give you the best view of Vigan than the Bantay Church Bell Tower. The belfry is situated on a hill overlooking the Bantay district in northeast Vigan. <br>

    You'll need to climb a winding staircase to get to the top of the brick structure, where you'll find an enormous bell hanging right in the middle of the tower.<br>

    The watchtower served as a good vantage point for the natives of Ilocos to see approaching enemies during the Spanish reign and World War II.<br>

    Today, people honor the memory of the tower by taking pictures at the foot of the hill, making it look as if they're holding it dearly on the palm of their hands or forming a heart shape with their arms extended over the tower.<br>
    <img src="img/bantay.jpg" width="400" height="200"/>
    </p>


    <h3>Pagburnayan Jar Factory</h3>
    <p>
    One good thing about touring Vigan is that you get to learn a lot about its history, culture, and way of life through the town's homegrown establishments. <br>
    In order to help people appreciate the industry of jar-making, the factory is open for tourists who want to see and experience pottery making first hand, from simple, basic designs to more artistic earthen jars.<br>

    The staff will also tell you an interesting background about the origins of pagburnayan, the art of producing jars, which was inspired by Chinese traders who came to settle in Vigan and then later intermarried with Ilocanos and Ilocanas.<br>
    <img src="img/jar.jpg" width="400" height="200"/>
    </p>


    <h3>Dancing Fountain Show at Plaza Salcedo</h3>
    <p>
    The park between Vigan Cathedral and the Provincial Capitol turns from a haven for picture taking at day to a stage of dancing lights at night that everyone can enjoy for free. <br>

    Plaza Salcedo features an outdoor light and water show that's comparable to those you might see in other countries.<br>

    As darkness falls, the fountain area at Plaza Salcedo gets jam-packed with tourists who come to witness a spectacular show of bright laser lights that illuminate the square. <br>

    Jets of water spout from "dancing fountains" right on cue, making it look as if they're moving with flickering lights and slow- to fast-tempo music playing on the background.<br>

    Everything is so well executed you can imagine the waters doing turns and leaps, and then returning to the same position before another round of mesmerizing dance performance begins.<br>
    <img src="img/fountain.jpg" width="400" height="200"/>

    </p>


    <h3>Baluarte Zoo</h3>
    <p>
    Not too far from the center of Vigan City, you'll find the Baluarte Resort and Mini Zoo sprawling on roughly 100 hectares of rolling plains and hills.<br> 

    The zoological park belongs to local politician Chavit Singson who used his property to share his love for safari to the public.<br>

    Admission is free, and you can take snapshots with the more tamed animals like birds and ponies. <br>

    Baluarte's version of Jurassic Park includes make-believe life-size dinosaurs, which can be an amusing background for your photoshoots. There are a lot of activities in Baluarte Zoo you can try.<br>

    Of course, it's best if you stay clear of wild animals in the Baluarte like snakes, crocodiles, lions, and tigers, among others, and just settle for the daily shows featuring the animals that are kept in the zoo.<br>

      <p>Known as the “Santorini of the North”, Vitalis Villas mirrors that of the famous landscape of Santorini in Greece with its cubiform villas painted in a wash of white and blue.<br>
      This mountain of elegant villas named after the owner’s favorite local painter with French origins, Macario Vitalis, can be considered as the most luxurious and scenic among the many accommodations in Ilocos.<br>
      These villas that overlook the sea are also a work of art as they sport many pieces from the country’s most sought-after artists namely Ben Cabrera, Fred Baldemor, and Macario Vitalis himself.</p><img src="img/villas.jpg" width="400" height="200"/>

      <p> The abel cloth is known for being a strong, colorful material. The fabric is so strong and beautiful that some families have them as heirlooms that last as long as their antique furnishings. The abel is made from yarns of cotton or sagut that are sourced from the many lands in northern Luzon that are dedicated to the growing of this plant. After the cotton is harvested, it is prepared into yarns and dyed. The different colored yarns are then arranged in a wooden handloom to create varied and unique designs. The process is intricate and labor-intensive. Weavers must master synchronizing the movements of their hands and feet to properly use the wooden handloom.
